Seems that everywhere you go, people are talking about FUEL. How much will it cost? How can I use it more wisely? Where will it come from? We all use it. We all need it for the journeys we go on. But what about the journey that God has called us to? What about the mission that Christ is leading us on? Join us starting July 12-13 for the next four weeks as we uncover God's true source of FUEL.
