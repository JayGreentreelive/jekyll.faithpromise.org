      <p>Welcome to the Children's Ministry of Faith Promise Church. fpKids is uniquely designed for kids birth through 5th grade, where our goal is to grab your child's attention so Jesus can change their heart.</p>

      <p>We do this through engaging environments and creative biblical teaching. Using everyday people just like you, we work together to teach kids how to do the greatest thing they can possibly do with their lives... love Jesus with all their heart, mind, and strength.

          <h3 class="Faq-question">When will my child move from one room to the next?</h3>

          <div class="Faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Nursery / Crawlers / Walkers</strong><br>
              Generally these room transitions are based upon whether or not your baby is proficiently crawling/walking. For example, a toddler will remain in the Crawler room until he/she is walking the majority of the time without assistance.
            </p>

            <p><strong>2 Years to PreK</strong><br>
              Once your child turns 2 years old, their room transitions are based upon age. For example, the day your child turns 3 years old he/she will move to the 3 year old room.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Kindergarten to 5th grade</strong><br>
              Transitions change in elementary and follow the Knox County School calendar. When the new school year begins for Knox County, then we transition all our elementary students from one grade to the next.
