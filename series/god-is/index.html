How do you view God?  It seems that we all try to make God in our own image... we choose the attributes about Him that we like and then try to put Him in our own little box.  But God is so much bigger than we realize, more loving than we'll ever know, and He is here with us now and always!  You won't want to miss a single week of this challenging four-week series as we discover the truths about who God really is.
