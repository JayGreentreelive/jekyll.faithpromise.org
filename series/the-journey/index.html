The Journey three-week sermon series begins on November 8-9. You won't want to miss a single weekend as we prepare to launch out into the most exciting time in the life of Faith Promise! We will talk about our Future, our Purpose and our Community as we prepare to give sacrificially in order to build and reach more lost and dying souls in our seven-county area. What will God do thorough each of us?
