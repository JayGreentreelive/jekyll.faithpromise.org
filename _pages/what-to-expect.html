  <h2>Welcome to Faith Promise Church</h2>
  <p>As you take a look around, you will notice that we're a little different. It is our desire to provide a place where you can genuinely worship God and be challenged to grow and make a difference in the lives of others.  <a href="##welcomeMore" class="read-more">Read More</a></p>
  <div id="welcomeMore">
    <p>When you come, the only thing we ask of you is simple... relax. You're with friends. Whether you've never been to church before or you're a seasoned church veteran, you can anticipate an encouraging and enlightening experience.</p>
    <p>Faith Promise is one church in multiple locations with an extraordinary vision to impact the unchurched of the world for God. We strive to create an atmosphere for people to connect with God and experience life change. Through the use of music, drama, and video we desire to connect the message of Christ with the heart of each person.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>We invest heavily in our children and teenagers, believing them to be some of the greatest influencers of the future. Our <a href="/children">children's ministry</a> meets during each adult service. Children learn and grow through large group teaching, crafts, stories, drama, and small group interaction.</p>
    <p>To save time, you can print out the <a href="../../uploads/ministries/family-registration-form.pdf">Family Registration Card</a> (pdf) at home, fill it out, and bring it with you.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Our Faith Promise UT Campus doesn't offer childcare as a part of our ministry. If you have kids and are looking for a place to plug in, <a href="##campuses" onclick="fp.showCampusSelection(); return false;">check out our other campuses</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="#campusClass('pel blount')#">Students</h2>
  <p>fpStudents is where life happens for middle and high school students. Each week students come to experience live worship, relevant teaching from the Bible, and interactive games, plus a chance to connect in a great small group. 6-12th grade students have a chance to grow closer to God and each other in a high-energy atmosphere that will change them each week.

  <h2>Worship</h2>
  <p>Our overall mission and purpose of the Worship Ministry of Faith Promise Church is to provide tools for engaging the hearts of men and women to the heart of God. We do this by providing an environment of authentic contemporary worship and use a wide range of media to achieve this goal.</p>

  <h2>Common Questions</h2>

  <ul class="faq">
    <li>
      <a class="question">What denomination is Faith Promise Church?</a>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Faith Promise Church is an autonomous, self-governing group. We have chosen to participate with other groups of churches for missions, evangelism and support. In this effort, we support missions individually and corporately. (For a listing of our core beliefs, <a href="/beliefs-and-values">click here</a>.)</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="question">Are the weekend services identical?</a>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes.  Each of the services features the same music and teaching.  <span class="#campusClass('pel')#">The only difference is that sign language interpretation is available on Saturdays at 6:00 pm.</span></p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="online">
      <a class="question">What should I wear?</a>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Faith Promise is very casual. You'll find people in anything from jeans and t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops, to dresses and dress shirts. Wear whatever makes you the most comfortable.</p>

    <li class="online ut">
      <a class="question">What do you have for my kids?</a>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We're glad you asked! Our awesome children's ministries are in session during each of the adult services. While you're experiencing the life-changing worship and teaching in the Worship Center, your kids will be experiencing life-changing worship and teaching of their very own.</p>
        <p>When you arrive at FPC, go to the Family Registration area in the lobby to check your children in to fpKids. Our check-in procedure takes a few minutes for new guests, so please plan to arrive 15 minutes prior to the service time. This will allow time to check in and get your child settled in to his or her classroom with enough time for you to make your way into the Worship Center before the service begins.</p>
