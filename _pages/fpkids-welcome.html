      <p>Welcome to the Children's Ministry of Faith Promise Church. fpKids is uniquely designed for kids birth through 5th grade, where our goal is to grab your child's attention so Jesus can change their heart.</p>

      <p>We do this through engaging environments and creative biblical teaching. Using everyday people just like you, we work together to teach kids how to do the greatest thing they can possibly do with their lives... love Jesus with all their heart, mind, and strength.
