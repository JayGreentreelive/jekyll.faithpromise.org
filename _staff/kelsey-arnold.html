<div class="StaffProfile-bio">
Hi! My name is Kelsey. My husband and I have been attending Faith Promise for a little over a year now. In April of this year I was granted an amazing opportunity to come on staff as the Assistant to the Pastor of Outreach and Missions. I have always had a passion for serving others and absolutely LOVE what I do. I love to laugh and have a good time.

When I am not in the office, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I also like to spend time outdoors, whether I am kayaking, riding my bike (which I'm terrible at), or sitting down to read a good book, there's nothing better than the warmth of the sun beaming down on my skin.
