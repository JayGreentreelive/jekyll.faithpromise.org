<div class="StaffProfile-bio">
<p>In my role as Pastor of Leadership Development and Stewardship I partner with staff and volunteers to increase leadership capacity and stewardship across Faith Promise. From 2009-2014 I served as Pastor of Family Ministry. Prior to joining the staff I served for 24 years in public schools. From 1990-2009 I was part of the faculty at Oak Ridge High School serving in a variety of roles including: teacher, coach, vice principal, athletic director, and principal.</p>
<p>My wife Emily, of 25 years, and I have been members of Faith Promise since the church began. I volunteered in a number of ministry areas including serving as an elder, student ministry, school of leaders, and membership classes.</p>
<p>In addition to my role at Faith Promise I provide executive coaching to business leaders. I have a doctorate in executive leadership as well as being a John Maxwell Team Certified Coach, Speaker and Trainer. In addition to executive coaching, I speak frequently to business teams and organizations.</p>
<p>I enjoy family time, and Em, Zach (20 years old), and Maggie (17 years old). We love traveling, especially to the beach! In addition to family fun I enjoy sports, reading, exercising, and time with friends.</p>
