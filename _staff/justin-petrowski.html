<p><strong>ABOUT ME:</strong><br>I've been a follower of Christ since 1987 and can say with confidence that it's the best decision I've ever made. I have been a member of Faith Promise Church since its inception in 1995. I have always enjoyed serving here - so when the opportunity arose to serve here full-time I took it! I have been on staff at Faith Promise since 2001 as an intern in the Worship Ministry and have served on full-time staff since 2003. Since then I've had the unique privilege of ministering to thousands of my brothers and sisters each week through my gift of music. I attended Oak Ridge High School in Oak Ridge, TN and graduated there in 1999. I attended the University of Tennessee after that and graduated in 2003 with an honors degree in mathematics. I have been married to my beautiful wife Kara since October 2006.</p>
<p><strong>FAVES:</strong><br>I love to read, watch and play sports, and make music. I enjoy spending time with my wife and with friends. As far as music goes, I love it all...you'll find me listening to anything from Coltrane to Coldplay, Sigur Ros to Sergei Rachmaninoff, U2 to the David Crowder Band and Hillsong. I'm always into something different. I love to read as well and I love exploring the Bible through fresh sets of eyes. Some of my favorite books include Velvet Elvis by Rob Bell, Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller, and A Generous Orthodoxy by Brian McLaren. Check them out! I'm also a HUGE fan of the Green Bay Packers, the Boston Red Sox, NASCAR, and University of Tennessee athletics. Go VOLS!</p>
<p>God bless you!<br>Hebrews 12:1-3</p>
