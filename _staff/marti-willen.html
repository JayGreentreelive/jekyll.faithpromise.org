<div class="StaffProfile-bio">
<p>I came on staff in 2007, and I absolutely love working at FPC! I have a fantastic life, thanks to my awesome husband, Tim, and our boys, Jacob and Caleb. I love hanging out with my family, reading, singing, and most of all, I love laughing.</p>
<p>Some random facts about me are that I moved 15 times as a kid, feet gross me out, and I got to hold the Olympic Torch while in China! Both of my boys weighed 10 pounds at birth, and they were both 22 &frac34; inches long! I'm a perfectionist by nature, but by His Spirit I am learning that continuously perfecting my relationship with God is the most important thing I could ever do. FPC has given more opportunities than I could have ever dreamed of, and I am so grateful that God led me to a place where He is constantly moving.</p>
