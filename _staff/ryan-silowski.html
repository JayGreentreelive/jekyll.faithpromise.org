<div class="StaffProfile-bio">
<p>I was born in New Orleans, LA, and moved to east Tennessee in the early 2000's. I was home schooled for all twelve years of my primary education, and after high school I went to Johnson Bible College (now Johnson University).</p>
<p>I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelors of Science in Biblical Studies and Digital Video Production. I have always had a love for storytelling, and video is the primary way we communicate stories in this day in age. I have loved films and filmmaking for some time.</p>
<p>In college I spent two summers in Seattle, WA, and it quickly became a second home for me. In my senior year of college, I had the privilege to be a Director of Photography for a small Christian feature film made in the Knoxville area. I have also participated in several competitions for the Knoxville film festival.</p>
<p>Through some of my internships in college, I became the Student Pastor at Life Point Church. In September of 2013, Life Point became a Faith Promise Campus, and I stayed on in my role of Student Pastor.</p>
